        <dt>HTML ELEMENT</dt>
        <dd>An HTML element is a fundamental building block of a web page, defined using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML elements are used to structure the content of a web page and provide meaning to the web browser about how to display that content. Each HTML element is represented by a pair of tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag specifies the type of element, and the closing tag marks the end of that element.</dd>
        <dt>HTML Tag</dt>
        <dd>In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), a "tag" is a fundamental component used to define elements within a web page. Tags are used to mark up or structure the content of a web page, and they consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).</dd>
        <dt>Angular Bracket</dt>
        <dd>Angle brackets are used to enclose and delimit specific elements or expressions within a document or code.</dd>
        <dt>HTML attribute</dt>
        <dd>In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), attributes are additional information or properties that can be added to HTML elements. These attributes provide extra details about an element or modify its behavior. Attributes are typically specified within the opening tag of an HTML element and are written as name-value pairs, separated by an equal sign (=).</dd>
        <dt>HTML comment</dt>
        <dd>In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), comments are used to add explanatory notes or remarks within the HTML code that are not displayed in the rendered web page. Comments are a way for web developers to include information for themselves or others working on the code without affecting the appearance or functionality of the webpage. HTML comments are enclosed within <!-- and --> tags. Anything placed between these tags is treated as a comment and is not interpreted by the web browser.</dd>
        <dt>HTML special character</dt>
        <dd>In HTML, special characters are characters that have special meanings or reserved functions within the HTML markup. These characters cannot be used directly in HTML code because they may be interpreted as markup or cause rendering issues.</dd>
        <dt>HTML object element</dt>
        <dd>The <object> element in HTML is used to embed external resources or objects, such as multimedia files (like audio or video), interactive elements, or even entire HTML documents within a web page. It provides a way to include external content that can be displayed within the web page's content area.</dd>
